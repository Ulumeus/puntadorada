- question: How many lots are available and what sizes?
  answer: "In this first phase, we're launching 59 exclusive lots (8 already reserved, 51 available) in three sizes: 38 lots of 150m² ($250M center/$260M corner), 6 lots of 160m² ($270M center/$285M corner), and 15 lots of 200m² ($300M center/$315M corner). Each lot allows construction from 32m² up to 128m² depending on the chosen modular design."

- question: Under what legal framework is the project organized?
  answer: Punta Dorada is structured under Colombia's Horizontal Property Regime. This guarantees clear rules for co-ownership, administration, and use of common areas. Buyers receive full legal title to their lots, with all permits already approved.

- question: Can I choose my own builder?
  answer: Yes, you have complete freedom to choose your builder. The developer delivers the infrastructure and common areas. The construction of each cabin is the owner's responsibility, complying with the project's architectural standards. Upon request, the developer can recommend up to three qualified independent construction companies.

- question: How does the rental program work?
  answer: The rental program is optional and professionally managed, based on the Punta Dorada Barú model. Income is not pooled - each cabin has its own account. Owners receive 60% of gross income; after service fees and 5% FF&E reserve, the net participation is approximately 49.2%. Independent Airbnb is not allowed to maintain quality standards.

- question: How do you access Punta Dorada?
  answer: Punta Dorada is accessible exclusively by sea, which reinforces its private and pristine character. Owners and guests have guaranteed access to the beach and use of the amenities of the 80-room beachfront hotel.

- question: What is the payment plan?
  answer: "The payment plan is very flexible: 30% down payment (divided into 3 payments of 10% each), 50% financed over 24 months with monthly installments, and 20% upon project delivery. Completely managed through Central Trust for total security and transparency."

- question: What amenities does the project include?
  answer: Owners will have access to a hotel with minimum 50 beachfront rooms, private beach, pools, restaurants, spa and other hotel services. Sustainable infrastructure solutions will be implemented, including options like Starlink for high-speed internet.

- question: Can I resell my property?
  answer: Yes, owners can resell their property at any time, subject to compliance with Colombian law and the horizontal property regulations. You can also transfer your purchase rights to a third party before construction, notifying the trust company.

- question: Can the cabins include a kitchen?
  answer: Yes, cabins can include a kitchen, but the design must comply with safety standards and community regulations. Options include electrical installation or propane gas, subject to approval.

- question: Is Punta Dorada a good investment?
  answer: "Punta Dorada is primarily a lifestyle purchase focused on recreation and exclusivity. Although long-term appreciation is expected (Cartagena is the #1 destination in Colombia), returns are not guaranteed. The rental program can help cover ownership costs, but income is not guaranteed and may vary by season and occupancy."

- question: How long will it take before we can build our units and when will the infrastructure be ready?
  answer: |
    The project is entering its first development phase, focused on preserving the natural beauty of the location while preparing for planned growth. The property remains in its most authentic state—lush, pristine, and ready to be transformed into a destination that balances nature with the comfort and design characteristic of the Curio collection.  
    Infrastructure works—roads, utilities, and base systems—will begin once the first 56 lots are fully reserved. This approach allows us to progress responsibly, guaranteeing quality and sustainability at every stage.  
    Those who join in this phase secure a more favorable entry point, with projected appreciation of approximately 20% once infrastructure construction begins.
